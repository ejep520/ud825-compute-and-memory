     * where you can cache current results for future re-use.

     * In this case, recursive Fibonacci calls fib8 which calls fib7 and fib6, but that fib7 call
     * calls fib6 again and fib5, So now you've got two fib6's and one fib5 call, but each of those
     * fib6 calls will have a fib5 and fib4, so now you have three calls to calculate fib5, blah,
     * blah, blah.  Recursive fibonacci is terrible.  Iterating lets you calculate fibX once,
     * use that result twice, and move on.
     *
     * @param positionInFibSequence  The position in the fibonacci sequence to return.
     * @return the nth number of the fibonacci sequence.  Seriously, try to keep up.
